# PM-as-Builder Training

A 12-week, weekend-based training plan for product managers who want to go beyond prompting AI coding tools and actually operate in a codebase.

## Who is this for?

Product managers who:
- Have some CS background (even if it was years ago)
- Are expected to fix contained bugs and ship POC features using AI coding tools
- Want to stop being "just a prompter" and start understanding what the AI is actually doing
- Need to credibly hand off code to engineers with real context

## The plan

The full curriculum is in [`plan.md`](plan.md). It's structured as:

| Phase | Weeks | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **1. Environment & Navigation** | 1–3 | Terminal, git, reading code, how services work |
| **2. AI-Assisted Development** | 4–7 | Claude Code mastery, Codex mastery, first bug fix, first feature |
| **3. Production Readiness** | 8–10 | Code review literacy, testing & CI/CD, multi-language comfort |
| **4. Capstone & Reflection** | 11–12 | Build something real, document your journey |

**Time commitment**: 4 hours/week (2 hrs Saturday, 2 hrs Sunday). 48 hours total.

**Tools**: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) + [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/). VS Code as IDE.

**Primary language**: Go (with Kotlin and JS/TS exposure).

## End state

After 12 weeks, you should be able to:
1. Navigate and understand an unfamiliar codebase
2. Fix a contained bug (no external dependencies) with AI assistance
3. Ship a simple feature as an alpha/POC
4. Write and run tests
5. Respond to code review comments intelligently
6. Hand off your work to an engineer with clear documentation

## How to use this

1. Read [`plan.md`](plan.md)
2. Fill in start dates for each week
3. Follow the Saturday/Sunday structure
4. Keep a learning journal (3 bullets per session: learned, confused, explore next)
5. Check off tasks as you go
